In order to compile and run our code, you will need to be running
some version of Linux.  This is because our build scripts and other
tools are made to run on Linux only.  First, you will need to execute
the following commands in order to load the CUDA toolkit and cmake modules.

module load cuda-toolkit/8.0
module load cmake

It is a good idea to place these commands in your .bashrc file so that they do not
have to be manually entered upon every restart.

Next, assuming that you have checked out our source directory into $SRCDIR,
perform the following steps.  In case there is no build directory present,
run the following commands:

cd $SRCDIR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake $SRCDIR

CMake will download the packages needed for this project (i.e., HDF5).  It will
also generate a Makefile, enabling you to compile the project with "make."
You can then run the compiled program as follows, where <number> should be
replaced with the batch size in question:

./ece408 ../data/test<number>.hdf5 ../data/model.hdf5 <number>

If the build directory is already present, then the CMake step may be skipped; simply
use "make" to compile the project.  Alternatively, you can use our conveniently
provided "run.sh" shell script, which will make clean, recompile, and then
run the compiled program.
